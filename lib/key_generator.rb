class KeyGenerator
#We need to figure out what we're going to pass to the key_generator.
#Will it be an optional argument?
#Will it be hard coded?
#Is this something we already have in the enigma.rb file?
#Will any tests in the encrypt_test.rb file become redundant?
#How does this tie into the runner to output a vaid key?
